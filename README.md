# Mod-5-Project (Qb-n-b)

# Full Stack React, Redux, Express, SQLite3/PostgresQL App

## Introduction

This is a full-stack solo project built using React, Redux, Express, and SQLite3/PostgreSQL. The application features user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, log out, and use a demo user login button for easy access. The app also includes two major CRUD features:

1. **Spots**: Users can create, read, update, and delete spots.
2. **Reviews**: Users can create, read, and delete reviews for spots.

The front-end is built with React, Redux (with normalized data), and CSS, while the back-end is powered by Express and SQLite3/PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - Redux: State management for React applications (with normalized data)
  - CSS: Styling for the front-end user interface
  
- **Backend**:
  - Express: Web framework for Node.js for handling server-side logic
  - SQLite3 / PostgreSQL: Database for storing user data, spots, and reviews
  
- **Authentication**:
  - Crsf.js : User authentication handling

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - Sign Up
  - Login / Logout
  - Demo User Login
  
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - **Spots**:
    - Create, Read, Update, and Delete spots
  - **Reviews**:
    - Create, Read, and Delete reviews

## Instructions to Launch Locally

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **PostgreSQL or SQLite3**: You will need a PostgreSQL or SQLite3 database set up locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quonnaq0711/Mod-5-Project.git
cd Mod-5-Project
```

## 2. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## 3. Install Frontend Dependencies 

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
## 4. Run Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
The backend server will typically run on http://localhost:8000.

## 4. Run Frontend Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
The frontend server will run on http://localhost:5173.

## 5.  Access the Application
Once both servers are running, navigate to http://localhost:5173 in your browser to access the app. You can now sign up, log in, and interact with the spots and reviews features.

---
## Usage
* Sign Up / Log In: Users can create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
* Demo User: You can quickly log in with a demo user by clicking the "Demo User Login" button.
* Spots: Users can create, view, update, and delete spots.
* Reviews: Users can create, view, and delete reviews for spots.
